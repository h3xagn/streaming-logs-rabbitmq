# Streaming logs using RabbitMQ

## Overview

More data stacks are shifting towards microservices and communication between them are essential as it sometimes need to communicate to more than one service. Message brokers play a critical part in this architecture by allowing services to communicate by routing messages and storing them. In this post we will be creating a simple python log viewer that consolidates errors across several apps and process error logs separately. The blog post with more detail is available here:

In a previous post, I covered a more simple log viewer using the log file and FastAPI:

## Repo structure and file descriptions

- `producerX.py`: Three simulated apps that produce log messages.
- `consumer1.html` and `js/consumer1.js`: Real-time web consumer display logs from the RabbitMQ exchange.
- `consumer2.py`: Simulated consumer that processes all messages from the queues.
- `message_example.json`: Example of JSON message generated by the logging handler, [python-logging-rabbitmq](https://pypi.org/project/python-logging-rabbitmq/).

The dependencies and virtual environment details are located in the `Pipfile` which can be used with `pipenv`.
